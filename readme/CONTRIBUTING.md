Please note that we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we ask you to follow in all your interactions with the project.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the only way to propose changes to the codebase. 

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Clone the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make sure your code meets all the [quality criteria](http://tbc).
3. If you've changed APIs, update the [docs](http://tbc).
4. Ensure all existing tests pass.
5. Raise the pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
You can check [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) for more information about a good coding style. It's important to respect and follow it up to keep good practices. 

## Ensure Changes Meet GDS Design and Accessibility Standards
Data Marketplace is a UK government service and changes should meet the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and the WCAG 2.2 accessibility standard at level AA, as described [here](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction). 

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://TBC)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](http://tbc). It's that easy!

## Write bugs with repro steps, expected behavior, and observed behavior

A *great* bug report should have:

- Steps a developer can take to reproduce the bug you found
  - Be specific!
  - Provide screenshots if necessary 
- What you expected would happen (but didn't)
- What actually happened (and how this doesn't meet your expectation)

Developers love proper bug reports!
